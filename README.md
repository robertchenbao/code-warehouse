## Inspiration
Computer programming can often improve productivity substantially. However, it is difficult to find and memorize shortcuts/commands in all programming languages. Moreover, it could take a lot of time -- possibly hours -- to find the right commands for the task. 

Therefore, it would be beneficial to enable programmers to share code snippets with others, and search for them easily. In this way, every one of them will be more productive at work.

## What it does
This app allows users to manage their code snippets, and share snippets to everyone. The app categorizes snippets by languages (e.g., Python, Java, and JavaScript), and allows users to find snippets from any of these categories.

## How I built it
- I used React, Tailwind.css, and Material-UI to power the frontend web application. I also used Formik to simplify forms.
- For the backend, I used Python (Django) to build a RESTful API backend, connected to a Postgres database
